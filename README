== BlogHelper

Having a closer look at ruby based blogging platforms like [serious](http://github.com/colszowka/serious) and [toto](http://cloudhead.io/toto), I missed some functionality.

This a a collection of tools usable in both platforms.

=== Features

- tag your posts
- use seo friendly page titles
- use the disqus comment counter
- a workaround for seriuous allowing you to use generic yaml fields

=== Usage

==== Installation

It's a piece of cake: just use the `gem` tool to get going with the _blog_helper_: `sudo gem install blog_helper`

If you want to use features that rely on accessing the http requests, like the _tag_ feature, you'll need to use the (_toto_prerelease_)[http://github.com/5v3n/toto]. Simply use `sudo gem install toto_prerelease --pre` to do so.

==== Applying a feature

Piece of cake, again: all you have to do is use `<% require 'blog_helper'%>` in your .rhtml or .erb file and call the corresponding methods.
