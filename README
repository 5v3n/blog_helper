== BlogHelper

Having a closer look at ruby based blogging platforms like [serious](http://github.com/colszowka/serious) and [toto](http://cloudhead.io/toto), I missed some functionality.

This a a collection of tools usable in both platforms.

=== Features

- tag your posts
- use seo friendly page titles
- use the disqus comment counter
- a workaround for seriuous allowing you to use generic yaml fields
